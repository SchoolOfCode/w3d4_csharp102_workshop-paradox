# C# 102

### Task 1

- Open 'lists' folder and then Program.cs.
- Create a new list called 'names' that contains 3 different names: James, Ben and Liz.
- For each of the names, console.WriteLine "Hello" and their name. For example, the first one would be "Hello James."

### Task 2

- Create another list called namesCapitals that contains 3 more names: Chris, Tao and Tim.
- This time, print to the console "Hello" and each of the names, with all their letters converted into capitals.

### Task 3

- Open the 'fibonacci' folder and then Program.cs
- Find the index of 'Liz' in the first list and print to the console.
- Now find the index of 'Bill' in the second list and print to the console.
- Finally, sort the 'names' list into alphabetical order and print out.

### Task 4

- Create a list called fibonacciNos that contains the numbers 1 and 1.
- Create a variable that is equal to the last value in fibonacciNos. Then create another variable that is equal to the penultimate number in fibonacciNos.
- Add these two variables together, and add the result to the end of the list.
- Create a while loop that completes the necessary stages above 20 times.
- Finally, for each of the numbers, print it to the console so that your console will contain the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence when you run the program.
- BONUS: Can you do the same thing with a for loop?

### Task 5

- Open the 'OOP' folder and then BankAccount.cs.
- Create three properties. They should all be public. The first should be called Number, the second called Owner and the third called Balance. The first two should be read-only and the second should have read and write access.
- Now create a constructor that takes in the arguments AccNo, Name and AccBalance. Link these to the properties above (Number is AccNo, Owner is name and Balance is AccBalance).

### Task 6

- Create a method called MakeDeposit. Every time this is called, it should take the account balance, add £20 to it and print out the new balance.
- Now create a method called MakeWithdrawal. Every time this is called, it should take the balance, remove £20 to it and print out the new balance.

### Task 7

- Open Program.cs in the OOP folder.
- Create a new BankAccount with your account number (make one up!), your name and an amount of money.
- Print these different values to the console.
- Invoke the MakeDepoosit and MakeWithdrawwal methods.
