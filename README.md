# C# 102

Have a go at the following tasks. Some of them might need a bit of Googling. Good luck!

## Task 1

- Create a new folder called `List`.
- Create a new console application in that folder.
- In Program.cs, create a new list called names that has James, Ben, Liz, Tao and Chris as its elements.
- Print the length of the array to the console.
- For each of the names, console.WriteLine "Hello" and their name.
- Print out what element is at index number 2.
- Use an appropriate method to find out whether the name "Bob" is in the list. Assign this to the variable 'present'.
- Find a way to print "Name contains Bob" if it is there and "No Bob here" if it doesn't.
- Add "Tim" to the end of the list.
- Add "Joe" to index 1 of the list (you might need to Google that!).
- Now print out the list. It should have 7 people in it.

## Task 2

- Create a new folder called `Array`.
- Again, create a new console application for that folder.
- Create an array that has elements for the different colours of the rainbow in order.
- Print these different colours to the console.
- Now create a new array with colours from the song "I can sing a rainbow" (feel free to Google it!).
- Add the elements from the rainbow array to the song array to make one great big one.
- Print this new array to the console.

## Task 3

- Create a new folder and console application called 'ArraysAndLists'.
- Create a list containing the numbers 1-5.
- Print these to the console.
- Print out the length of the list.
- Create an array called listToArray with the same number of elements as the list above. BONUS: Can you do it without just writing the number?
- Convert the 1-5 list so that the elements are now stored in the new array.
- Print the type of the array to the console... just to make sure!

## Task 4

- Create an array with the first 5 multiples of 5 in it.
- Now create an empty list.
- Use a for loop to add the elements from the array into the list.
- Print out the list contents to console.
- Print the type of the list to the console... again, just to make sure!
- BONUS: can you find an easier way to make the list rather than using a for loop? CLUE: look at something called System.Linq and .ToList.

## Task 5.The Challenge!

- Create a new folder and console application called `Fibonacci`.
- Create a list called fibonacciNos that contains the numbers 1 and 1.
- Create a variable that is equal to the last elements in fibonacciNos. Then create another variable that is equal to the penultimate number in fibonacciNos.
- Add these together and then add the result to the end of the list.
- Create a loop that completes the necessary stages above 20 times.
- Finally, for each of the numbers, print to the console.
- BONUS. Can you do the same thing without a for loop?
